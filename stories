Once upon a time in a wide forest lived a crow. It was summer at the time 
and hence the river was dried up.One day the crow was wandering for food in the 
hot afternoon, he didn't find any but started feeling thirsty.He searched for 
water nearby and was successful in finding a pot with water but at its brim.
