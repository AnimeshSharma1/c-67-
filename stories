Once upon a time in a wide forest lived a crow. It was summer at the time 
and hence the river was dried up.One day the crow was wandering for food in the 
hot afternoon, he didn't find any but started feeling thirsty.He searched for 
water nearby and was successful in finding a pot with water but at its brim.
He swiftly came to the pot and found the water at the brim.The crow was 
disappointed that he couldn't drink the water with such a small beak. 
While thinking for an idea he saw some pebbles around the pot and with a 
cunning smile he picked the pebbles and one by one put it in the pot .
 To his surprise he saw the water coming to the top of the pot and soon 
 as he could drink the water he did so . As his thirst was gone he flew away 
 searching for food.
